# Hands-on Machine Learning Plan

I am going to learn **Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems**.

## Environment setup (Windows)

1. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv`
2. Activate it: `./.venv/Scripts/activate`
3. Upgrade pip: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Capture the lock file as you add packages: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

## Study workflow

- Keep quick notes in `text.txt` or notebooks as you work through each chapter.
- Track code experiments per chapter in separate folders for clarity.
- Periodically rerun `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after adding new packages.

## Useful references

- Official book repository examples for cross-checking implementations.
- TensorFlow and scikit-learn docs for API updates beyond the book version.
